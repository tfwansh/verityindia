*I love researching about the old-school(pre-2008) internet( and low-key wish it to return, which is really childish), I also like niche, content-focused online communities, free from the rat race of SCALING and GROWTH(yeah, F the corporate... although it would be hilarious if I turn into one... I will probably, it's a necessary evil yet again, let's see... ). Currently, I am discovering the IRC, it looks pretty cool... and I think I might take it over Discord anyday.*
