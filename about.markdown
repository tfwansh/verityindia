*More of a cybercitizen, than a citizen. I love researching about the old-school internet and am interested in niche, content-focused online communities. Data-hoarding and archiving is pretty fun as well as really essential. Paranoid, data privacy freak. Currently, I am discovering the IRC(yeah u r free to make your assumptions), it looks pretty cool... and I think I might take it over Discord anyday. Was always interested in technically everything, or probably I was poor at deciding stuff ... this led me into the world of cybersecurity and startups. I often Fantasize about becoming a vigilante hacker, doesn't harm to dream right?*
