<p><em>More of a cybercitizen, than a citizen. I love researching about the old-school internet and am interested in niche, content-focused online communities. Data-hoarding and archiving is pretty fun as well as really essential. Paranoid, data privacy freak. Currently, I am discovering the IRC(yeah u r free to make your assumptions), it looks pretty cool… and I think I might take it over Discord anyday. Was always interested in technically everything, or probably I was poor at deciding stuff … this led me into the world of cybersecurity and startups. I often Fantasize about becoming a vigilante hacker, doesn’t harm to dream right?</em>
 </p>

<p>This site was created taking into consideration the thought that it was high time I started a blog and just START putting out stuff. I have loads of ideas on what to do with this website, like so many ideas that my giga brain just couldn’t handle it’s own load and forgot about all of them. This is the primary reason I have no idea what I am looking forward to do with this site. Another factor being … I have <strong>exams</strong>, a lot of them, I just won’t find any time till next year(2022) May-August to implement any major changes. The fact that I am typing this out rn instead of hitting the books, just says I am not getting much sleep tonight cause I will have to compensate for the lost time.</p>

<p>Why I am I using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">verityindia.tech</code> ? What does the term even mean?… <em>I DON’T KNOW!</em> I got this for free too, from a good friend and I’ll be using this till pretty much … next year(2022) September.</p>

<p>I’ll be able to get a perma address with a relevant name when I am able to pay for it, and this pretty much does the job for now as I do not really expect any traffic.</p>

<p>Thanks for the visit, I really appreciate it…
Have a good day!</p>

<p><strong>About Act 2:</strong></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if this is Act 2... where is Act 1? lolololol</code></p>

<p>Well yeah, I am yet to decide the name of this project. What I’m about to do here is try to develop a potential psychological drama(I guess that’s the term?), of course the difference being there is only one <em>fictional</em> character named z0br1s7(that’s how he addresses himself, poor guy needs to interact with a REAL human for the readers to know his REAL name… on a second thought, what even IS real at this point?…) instead of an array of characters(r/suddenlycoding), or actually you can SAY there are a lot of characters but not in the form you would SAY that those are actually characters, something on those lines. I have planned aroughly 4 Acts(or parts/seasons/chapters/etc), where Act 1 and 2 are kind of copressed into 1 and the latter, standalone(i.e, 2*5=10 + 2*10=20 =&gt; 10+20=30 chapters… quick mafs).I plan to be releasing them, slowly, over November, December 2021 and uptil maybe August 2022, after which I would need to just move on.</p>

<p>Of course, I might change my mind over a gazillion times(even this about section is not the off-hand original text), just trying it out so reformations might be quite common. Although I HOPE this is more or less the final format.</p>

<p>10 chapters excluding Prelude and epilogue in the first set of releases of the series, let’s see how it goes!</p>
