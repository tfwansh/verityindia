`# what is the probability that you are not overthinking it?`   
`$ High? ...`

`# Paranoia is just a mask for ignorance, a true denial, for fear of the worst. You are not actually overthinking it ... the darkest of your visions are  far worse than you generally fathom.`    
`$ Spooky right? How do you know this?`

`# you ALREADY know this, the only difference being, I've got the balls to say it in front of you.`  	
`$ oof, ... tbh, u are correct, like I wonder how much we've fallen apart.`

`$ Anyways, let's begin.`

### Another quick post, let's go,

There is nothing I can bring to the party, which hasn't been brought yet. I expect this post to be just another scream into the void, and why not? The facts have already been established a lot of times, and in much better ways, there is **absolutely** nothing groundbreaking about this post. This is NOT going to bring forward a revolution. Not saying efforts have been fruitless, atleast it got **me** talking about it ... right? 

I love advertisements!(is it an uncanny thing to say?) ... I mean of course, if they are well made, don't really force their way into places I don't want them to and especially when they are relevant enough, **TRAINED** on my browsing habits and personal data ... you know the feeling when you are shitting on that new overpriced iPhone released a couple days back in an Instagram chat and the next moment you see LIGHTNING DEALS on the same product while browsing youtube? It's surreal! 

And I wasn't being satirical, I do like some ads, they are witty, humourous, sometimes wholesome, persuasive, appeasing, all in all a lot of them manage to stir up an influx of emotions inside your soul ... just for that ONE click, just to stand out in an ocean of noise ... making good ads is no child's play ... I just respect them, and ofc... they are NECESSARY. `You know the drill` ... 

The lack of awareness of data privacy, anonymity and more or less a general understanding/estimation of the value one's data holds is terrifying, especially amongst people outside the tech sector or those who deal with marketing. Ironically, this is not shocking at all. 

It's the year 2021, guys, the same year MetaVerse was announced... and yeah you can pass this post as another one of 'those' posts but I'm scared of it, honestly. There is a lot to everything, this one webpage can never even summarize it, and honestly there is so much that mentioning a handful seems blatantly unjust.

I was scared of facebook in general actually, this account created some years ago by my dad just had my profile pic till now, and a friend list of some really good old friends whom I've not met for half a decade ... it's more than a quarter of my lifetime so u know that it matters. Well, whatever ... logged into the website after months and NOTE, this was after I supposedly formed a brand new identity( a new handheld device, a new mail ID, etc.), also this is after I have not installed Facebook on any of  my devices for over 3 years now:

!["Off-site data" stored on Facebook](/assets/images/index.png)

*off-site data stored on facebook, these are the websites I visited recently*



![Data for each site login](/assets/images/index2.png)

*login data for each website stored with date and time*

This was what Facebook was good enough to share with us. Also, I might be a late bloomer to this feature where you can download the off site data stored with your facebook account because as I said, I haven't been using the service at all, it seems it has been the other way round. What's more interesting is that these were the websites I visited on the Desktop, in a different Operating System, in a different browser, logged in with a different email account. It's almost incredible how they managed to pull off this system of data collection ... actually, KUDOS! I know you guys can even read THIS text as I type it out lol.

I just can't write out everything, you get the point I suppose. 

**Privacy** is an illusion. **Ownership** is an illusion. **Control** is an illusion.

I mean I am prepared for event X ... right? Common, this corporation can't be THAT evil, it only happens in dystopian novels and movies ... right? There are people in control, they will eliminate the shady figures and handle the state really well in times of crisis, we don't need to worry ... right? 

Oh! How badly I wish this was just unnecessary paranoia ... but it's never really a *Looney-ful day* ... ever, right? and what I presented above wasn't even a strong case towards my point ... not even scratching the surface, I mean seriously ... with all that in the kitchen that was the best I could come up with?

Anyways ... if you are reading this, I don't think it will be anytime soon or probably ... ever. Highly unlikely someone is just going to land upon this crapsite ... but if by whatever play of the fate, someone really did, I would ask them to maybe, share their thoughts with me at the email below. Take this as me just having that small talk before we sit down for some real work, and what I mean by that is I will try to put out some actual, useful content out here in the future. Even if it is just a weekly/monthly update I hope to make it really interesting for the readers.

So if you are interested ... I would really appreciate you clicking the link below to subscribe to this blog, I promise no spams, and no more than a single post each week. Any feedbacks/tips/ideas/chat on the email provided below. Thanks for reading, I'll see myself out.
